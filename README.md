# newsapp

This is post assessment as well as multithreading assignment.
In this I have used state management, navigation and routing.
I have also done model creation.
I have called APIs(newsapi) in the background with the help of isolates and shown data to the user.
I have also used url_launcher package.
In this app, category wise news are shown to the user.
There are also subcategories in each category.
